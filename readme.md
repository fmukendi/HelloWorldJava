## Determinate Next Version Based on History

Now that we have a `git commit` convention, we can jump in the next thing, that will make our first release ðŸŽ‰.

For do that, we are going to use [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version). After reading your git history and it will determinate what is the next release version.

[standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) will determinate automagically the next version to release based on your `git history`.

For do that it will consider:

**patches** (`1.0.0` â†’ `1.0.1`)

```bash
git commit -a -m "fix(parsing): fixed a bug in our parser"
```

**features** (`1.0.0` â†’ `1.1.0`)

```bash
git commit -a -m "feat(parser): we now have a parser \o/"
```

**breaking changes** (`1.0.0` â†’ `2.0.0`)

```bash
git commit -a -m "feat(new-parser): introduces a new parsing library
BREAKING CHANGE: new library does not support foo-construct"
```

A release has some tasks associated:

- ðŸ‘‰ Increment the version at `package.json`.
- ðŸ‘‰ Generate a new entry in your `CHANGELOG.md`
- ðŸ‘‰ Create a new specific git commit for the released version.
- ðŸ‘‰ Create a new `git tag` with the version associated.
